        <div class = "revealable">
          <p>My topic covers how the economically disadvantaged often do not have access to housing repair services because 
         they can't afford them. For low-income homeowners and renters, significant needed repairs can be a financial 
         stressor. This is a problem because it can lead to physical and mental health issues.

              <p> Imagine a family struggling to make ends meet. They live in a dilapidated home
              and struggle to keep up with home repairs. Research shows that living in subpar
              housing conditions can lead to physical and mental health issues. We believe that everyone, no matter their economic status, should be able to 
              obtain housing repair services and live in good housing conditions. If you support 
              this cause, please sign our petition in support of housing services for the 
              economically disadvantaged. </p>
